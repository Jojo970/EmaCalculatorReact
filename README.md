## To Do List

1. Give dark mode transition a smooth animation.

2. Allow for user registration and allow users to save strategies. 

3. Allow users to control timeframe to test.

4. Currently the graph generated is Danfo.js basic graph. Implementing a more advanced UI would be nice (least priority).
